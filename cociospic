To do this, you'll want to make sure there are no gaps in your perimeter, and definitely make sure that there are no spawnable tiles within your base. You'll want to make sure that structures are tight together, so cannons and other defensive structures can cover as many of them as possible.", "link":"https://www.imore.com/sites/imore.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/field/image/2016/04/clash-layout.jpg"},
