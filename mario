    {"firstName":"Basic moves", "lastName":"Tap while Mario is mid-air and you’ll perform a spin, which lowers you to the ground more slowly. A handy tactic for collecting difficult coins, or chaining together enemy kills. \n \n Also remember that when Mario hits a ledge face-first, he’ll grab a hold and clamber up. This makes it possible to get on top of platforms that in previous games would have been out of reach. \n \n To jump as high as possible, keep your finger on the screen when you tap to jump. If you’re struggling to reach particularly high areas, try switching to Luigi (once you've unlocked him) - he can jump higher than the others."},
    {"firstName":"How to play offline", "lastName":"One of the biggest pains with Super Mario Run is the way you have to be constantly connected to the internet in order to play. Not good news if you end up in a building where there’s no mobile signal, or in some kind of reception black hole.\n \nThankfully you can try connecting to WiFi networks on the move, if your signal is iffy. Check out our guide to connecting to free O2 WiFi in the UK, which is available in a huge range of locations across the country and free to anyone - not just O2 users."}
